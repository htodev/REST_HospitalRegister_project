their doctors. It will also contain basic information
about the condition of the patients. Ð¢he requirements are as
follows:

    * Each doctor must have  an user.
    * Each doctor  must list himself at define endpoint,
    which will be accessible to everyone.
    * Each doctor must keep a record of the patients admitted to it
    at special endpoint for that.
    * This record is accessible only for the doctors.
    * The doctor can delete or update the registry, but only for patients,
    related to it.
    * Only doctors can filter registry by doctors name.
    * There must be a list with names of all hospitalized patients visible to
    everyone.
    * Only admin and doctors (owners of the profile) can edin the profile.

    which will be accessible to everyone.

    at special endpoint for that.
    * This record is accessible only for the doctors.
    * The doctor can delete or update the registry, but only for patients,
    related to it.
    * Only doctors can filter registry by doctor name.
    * There must be a list with names of all hospitalized patients visible to
    everyone.
    * Everyone must be able to filter patients list by patient name.
    * Only admin and doctors (owners of the profile) can edit the profile.
